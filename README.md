## How to Use

To Run This file you must have node.js installed. 
If you do not have it installed you can download a copy here:

Once Downloaded We require the node package 'http-server' .
Type the following command into command-line to install:

    npm install -g http-server
            
Now we are ready to view the living room just type in a terminal in the folder directory. 

    http-server
    
This will start a local http-server. In the browser of your preference (Chrome Recommended) go to the url:
    
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/

From here we can view the living room. You can use the controls displayed on the screen to control the scene.
